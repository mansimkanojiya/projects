# K-Fold Cross Validation

This project demonstrates how to implement and evaluate a machine learning model using **K-Fold Cross Validation** in Python. The notebook (`K_fold_cross_validation.ipynb`) showcases how to split data into multiple folds, train a model on various subsets, and average the performance metrics for more reliable results.

## Overview

- **K-Fold Cross Validation** is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data.
- The code demonstrates:
  - Splitting data into `k` folds (e.g., 5 or 10).
  - Iterating through each fold, using one as the test set and the remaining as the training set.
  - Computing accuracy (or other metrics) on each fold.
  - Averaging performance metrics to get a more stable estimate.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.7+**  
2. **Libraries**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation
   - `numpy` for numerical computations
   - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and cross-validation utilities
   - (Optional) `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting

Usage
Load Your Dataset:
Replace any placeholder dataset paths or URLs in the notebook with your own data source.

Model Configuration:

By default, the notebook might use a certain model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, etc.).
Feel free to change hyperparameters or swap models to see how performance varies.
Run the Cells:

The notebook demonstrates the K-Fold process, printing out metrics like accuracy or F1 score for each fold.
A final average metric is computed to summarize model performance.
Analyze Results:

Check each fold’s accuracy to see if performance is consistent.
Investigate if certain folds produce significantly lower metrics—this might indicate outliers or data distribution issues.
