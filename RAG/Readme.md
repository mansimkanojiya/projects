# RAG Information Retriever

This project demonstrates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that combines information retrieval with generative models to provide enhanced, context-aware responses. The notebook (`RAG_information_retriever (1).ipynb`) contains code that indexes a document corpus, retrieves relevant information based on user queries, and then uses a generative model to produce enriched answers.

## Overview

- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines document retrieval and generative modeling to answer user queries with supporting context.
- **Document Indexing**: Builds an index from a corpus of documents or passages for efficient retrieval.
- **Generative Response**: Uses a language model to synthesize a final answer based on the retrieved context.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Improves response quality by grounding generative outputs in relevant information.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `faiss` (or an alternative retrieval library)
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - (Additional libraries as needed, e.g., `datasets`)

Usage
Prepare the Document Corpus:
Ensure you have a collection of documents or passages to be indexed. Update the notebook code with the correct data paths if necessary.

Run the Retrieval Pipeline:
Execute the cells to build the retrieval index and perform queries to retrieve the most relevant passages based on your input.

Generate Responses:
The generative model will use the retrieved context to craft a comprehensive answer. Experiment with different queries to observe how the model integrates the retrieved information.
